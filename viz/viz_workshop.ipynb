It contains a variety of information on the almost 4,000 people who were accused of practicing witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 in Scotland. This includes, but is not limited to: Accused peoples, accused families, cases, case persons, complaints, confessions, demonic pacts, denunciations, devil appearances, elf and fairy elements, imprisonments, and denunciations. For this workshop project, we will be focusing our study on the smaller, more specific “Demonic Pact” dataset (titled “WDB_DemonicPact.csv” on [data.world](https://data.world/)) that is included in the overall dataset. It concerns cases which involve alleged demonic pacts.\n"
